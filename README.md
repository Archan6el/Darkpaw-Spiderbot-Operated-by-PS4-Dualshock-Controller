# Darkpaw-Spiderbot-Operated-by-PS4-Dualshock-Controller

Python code to remotely control Adeept Darkpaw Spiderbot using a bluetooth connected dualshock PS4 Controller

This code is free to be expanded and improved by anyone!

Follow Adeept's tutorial for all necessary files: https://www.adeept.com/learn/tutorial-91.html

Essentially go through the entire tutorial to where all files are on the pi, and everything is set up and ready to go.

No files were modified except the ones present in this repo. SpiderG.py I personally modified, but not much. ps4.py contains the code that I developed to have the PS4 Controller operate the spider bot
