```onBoot.sh``` and ```startup.sh``` are both bash scripts used to get everything running when we start up the spider bot. ```onBoot.sh``` gets bluetooth up and operating and runs our ps4.py program. ```crontab -e``` contains the contents of my crontab that runs onBoot.sh on start up. startup.sh is used to run the webserver on the spider bot. ```rc.local``` contains the contents of the file at ```/etc/rc.local``` on your Pi that runs ```startup.sh``` on boot.
